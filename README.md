# React Development Environment

This is basically my standard development environment bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).. 

And rewired with [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) which helps to override CRA configs.

It's consist of ready `stylelint` (with styled-components presets), `eslint`, `prettier`, `styled-components`, CSS normalize with `injectGlobals.js`

It's a very nice start if your're not very familiar even with simple setup of the stuff :)
